When lies take over our world
======

Losing Pravda chronicled the development of journalism upon the collapse of the Soviet union to the recent regime of Putin. 

Rather than viewing the changes from the view of an ordinary audience in "Between two fire", here we have a in-depth digest from the journalist point of view on how journalism turns into "systematic falsehood and fabrication".  And how these changes reshape the operation of news outlets, political climate, and most importantly modern Russians' attitude to life and politics. The author has put her field work together as a compelling, yet tragic story on the fallen from grace of the mass media and showed us the alarming consequences of what it is like to live in a "post-truth" world. It doesn't describe the ordinary people as poor victims, but a stakeholder with complexity: who were either "using the system for their advantage, avoiding public confrontation with it, “while mocking it in the private realm, at the kitchen table" nor "moral invalid[s] who both lacked inner integrity and laughed about it”. 


It is not only a good entry point to help think about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but also ponder on some similar phenomena we experience under neo-liberalism. As the author stated, "This profound moral disorientation is what much of this book is about."

### Journalism as a profession
Journalism focuses on truth-seeking and truth-telling. News give rise to  transparency that allow open discussion of how we want to organise our society, formulate our moral values and unite people via informing. Good journalist is a public communicator that can instigate changes by bringing problems into the spotlight. Via investigative reports and showing the truth, journalists are also key player on building trust of the public to the government.

Journalism is composed of truth-seeking and truth-reporting, with these four qualities: accuracy, sincerity, seriousness reflexivity and courage. In brief, truth-speech involved the painstaking effort of digging up facts, understanding the importance of informing the public about it and speaking it to power, to demand justice.

It is a practice of parrhesia. According to  Michel Foucault, parrhesia was a way of speaking that was clear and direct, with nothing left to interpretation. It was also based in conviction and experienced as a moral duty. Finally, parrhesia always involved speaking from a position of less power.


"Truth only becomes truth when one risks their life to find it. Truth needs to be sought after openly, or we will lose it. If we quietly tolerate a thousand small things, they will add up to one intolerable condition."

### Journalism in reality under power imbalance 
The state of journalism was vulnerable in soviet time. News room is the only place that people could raise their political grievance, as people could not openly oppose how the communist party run the country. Journalists became the investigator to identify the societal problems and work as an ambassador to talk to the regime to work out a solution. In that way, journalism contribution to the foundation of public trust.


Regardless of the tall ideal of journalism, news was weaponised by politicians for their own personal gain. Privatization of this once national sector, News outlets struggled to finance themselves and resorted to sponsorships from politicians. The money came with binding, journalists either had to report with partiality, or going as far as faking criminal evidence to discredit their sponsors' political opponents. News reporting had turned into political advertising, sowing distrust in the society. Journalists as professionals also had to forego its standard and mockingly liken themselves to prostitutes, selling out to their manager and sponsors.


"For all-around brain-fucking, of course! [dlia vseobshchego mozgoeba-tel’stva].” “What do you mean?” I mumbled. “Well,” she paused for a second, clearly enjoying my bewilderment, “politicians are fucking with us, we are fucking with the readers, and the readers don’t give a fuck about what we do!"


"To contemporary propagandists, however, the notion of factual accuracy has become superfluous. As a result, made-up stories, nonexisting events, pseudodocumentaries, invented threats, and phantom realities populate news and commentary on federal television today like at no other point in the country’s recent history. Such news and commentary enjoy high ratings, and that seems to matter more than anything else to media overseers in the Kremlin."


The final stage of the Russian media machine is no only about establishing a narrative for political means (i.e. boasting Russian imperialism), but also to confuse and distract the public so much to give up exercising logic.

### Coping with lies

"What does public discourse look like in a society that seems to have lost interest in seeking truth and speaking it to power? Did the kernel of truth-seeking disappear entirely from public space, or was it channeled somewhere else?"


The author points to mass banal cynicism and cynicism of those in power. 

"Cynicism – as mistrust of people and institutions, as the sense of being manipulated and deceived, as bracing oneself for the worst – became an adaptive mechanism for living under the conditions of that permanent crisis."


Cynicism had led to distancing and disinhibition to the regime officials for power play. The distancing from the public is a display of superiority and it led to shamelessness of authority responding to public criticism. 


"officials at all levels have been taking cues from the top that they can increasingly mock, ridicule, and insult anyone with less power, including journalists, with impunity. "


There is no accountabilities on wrong doings by government officials and a total collapse of communication between the public and the authority. The propaganda machine became "rigid" and unintelligible. 


"Speech was polluting when it was high in pathos, contained declarative assertions and logical appeals, and made frequent use of concepts and abstract terms. Polluting speech unnecessarily “loaded” people “down” with excessive information (gruzit’), overtaxing their capacity to feel, think, and act."


So want about the people knowing that they are stuck with perpetual lies with no alternatives? 

**"The result of a consistent and total substitution of lies for factual truth is not that the lies will now be accepted as truth, and the truth be defamed as lies, but that the sense by which we take our bearings in the real world – and the category of truth vs. falsehood is among the mental means to this end – is being destroyed. And for this trouble there is no remedy."**


"the growing sense of social and moral disorientation and the emerging desire to withdraw"


People even gave up critical thinking all together, keeping their mind "clean and empty" while keeping a general positive attitude --- Arendt's famous thoughtlessness. 


"As a result, both cynicism and thoughtlessness become mechanisms through which people can shield themselves from the risk and discomfort of examination – of self and others – and from the pain of making up one’s mind"


They no longer read any news, play no attention to knowledge as it is mentally too taxing and indulge themselves in entertainment or excessive mocking of the poor, the sick and any political enemies of Kremlin. The local problems and power abuses by Russian authority were left beyond public discussions. 

## Restoring truth via collective actions

The book ended with a positive note about changes taken place since 2012. Protests against election fraud sprout up across the country. A wave of civil movements had shifted the Russian people from apathy to direct actions in politics. Demands of truth and moral clarity led people to self-organise as journalists and observers to fact-check and combat propaganda generated from the mass media.


"Another pathos-reducing tactic, which Alexei Navalny used success-fully with apathetic citizens, was to argue that becoming politically or civically involved can be “easy and fun.” Navalny managed to get large numbers of people involved in his team’s various political and civic projects, including working as an observer during elections, anticorruption monitoring, and partaking in the operations of his “well-meaning machine of propaganda.” The choice of “well meaning” (dobraya) is crucial here because it signals having no intention to deceive that is usually associated with propaganda and manipulation."

## Not only in Russia

The author also made an interesting point that the degradation of mass media is not because of Russia but capitalism in Russia. Nonetheless, it is the Soviet that cultivated the special vulnerabilities of the press industry before privatization totally wrecked it. 


"Capitalism is built on the creation of false values. It requires a toleration for, and even some indifference to, lying: advertising, marketing, and political campaigning would not survive without it."


"Capitalist actors are more interested in being effective rather than in being true. A large dose of epistemological relativism is thus built into capitalism, with money being the greatest relativizing force of all, as Marx noted a long time ago."


We can draw a lot of parallels in the incidents mentioned in the book with our modern-day media content. For example, the author mentioned the show "Laughing at the sick" that the show hosts had to crack jokes on all illnesses such as cystic fibrosis. That kinda reminded me of "Don't look up". Not to mention all the trends on stop reading news to maintain our well-beings. Not surprisingly, most of the air time are jammed with entertainment, food, fashion and traveling to convince us to consume. On another extreme, we spend more hours in media designed to trigger our emotions, mostly outrages.  


"Similar to the story I told in this book, the crisis of journalism in the United States has been accompanied by a growing spread of cynicism in American political and public culture. This cynicism is the disappointment and hopelessness many Americans feel at the inability of public institutions, including journalism, to bring about much-needed political and social change. Mounting economic dispossession, growing moral righteousness, and unending political strife have eroded many people’s faith in rationality, modernity, progress, and justice."


And worst of all, we normalised lying, and even actively participate in social media to curate a version of our life we like. While drowning in dissatisfaction in reality, we even change edit our life to reformulate a new "narrative" to make us feel better about ourselves. It seems like that we are replacing reality with our preferred delusions. 


But the author believes that "the desire to seek truth is a fundamental part of the human condition.". And only by seeking truth we can build a shared reality with others. And having a sense of togetherness is the key to a better society.


**"Truth was out there: it might have been concealed, it might have been feared, other things might have been masquerading for it, but its very existence was undeniable, and finding and speaking it were considered a virtue."**
