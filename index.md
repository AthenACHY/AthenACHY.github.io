  This is what I enjoy doing.

<p>I am a trying to be bioinformatician. Typically I read papers and wonder how people pull out all these amazing analyses. So the only way to find out is to DIY again, using their data and methods. I fail numerous times; sometimes I succeed.</p>

<p>This a blog about trails and errors; all the failing forwards to work with big-data to solve biological questions. </p>

I used Clean-blog for over 2 years as my template, but it no longer works. So I am now migrating to **Alembic**.
Many thanks to the creator that build the framework of the site and if you also would like to make your won blog, do give it a [try]("https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic").
